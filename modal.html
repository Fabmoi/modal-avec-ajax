            <p>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Soon enough. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Is that a cooking show? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
            <p>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? <strong> Ummm…to eBay?</strong> <em> I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse!</em> I asked you to get busy!</p>
            <h2>What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</h2>
            <p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</li><li>We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</li><li>Why would a robot need to drink?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</h3>
            <p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</li><li>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</li><li>They're like sex, except I'm having them!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>No, she'll probably make me do it. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
            <p>We're rescuing ya. That's not soon enough! Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>
            <p>Negative, bossy meat creature! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</p>
            <p>So, how 'bout them Knicks? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
            <p>So, how 'bout them Knicks? I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
            <p>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>
            <p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
            <p>Say what? Large bet on myself in round one. Soothe us with sweet lies. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
            <p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I never loved you. Ow, my spirit! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
            <p>Bite my shiny metal ass. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Guess again.</p>
            <p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
